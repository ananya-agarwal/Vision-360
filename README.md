# Vision 360

## Why This Project?
<ul>
<li> During the COVID-19 Pandemic, examination process were forced to move in online form. </li>
<li> While online exams/proctoring had help in cost cutting and helped to reach applicants even in remote area, the one major issue regarding to this system is use of UNFAIR MEANS. </li>
<li> Main Goal: Develop a second feed camera system which could be combined with the already existing laptop webcam and minimize the blind spots which were vastly present with a single camera system.</li>
<li> Online exams which are less costly can thus be conducted in the future as well which can be proctored and indeed save the money given to the Proctors. </li>
<li> This has its application even in the call centers, all type of online examinations and wherever there is a need of proctoring.</li>
</ul>

## Overview
<ul>
  <li> Hardware: A headband is prototyped via 3D modelling on CREO. It was later 3D printed. Special mount was created to place the camera for a better view. Band is made such that it completed the need of a microphone and a speaker which is a necessity of the online examinations. </li>
<li> This device smartly detects and prevents cheating by using AI combined with 360 degrees view to check if there are some objectionable means in the environment of the examine. </li>
<li> Software/ ML model: YOLOV4 or You Only Look Once, is a popular real-time object detection algorithm. It is helping us detect allowed vs not allowed objects during the examination.
<li> The webam, micrphone, speaker is connected to the laptop of the examinee. Laptop now has 2 cameras' access. One camera would check only at the front for the authentication of the person. Other camera is mounted on the examinee's head which will rotate 360 and check for the unfair means surrounding the examinee.</li>
</ul>

## Need Analysis
<ul>
  <li> 73% of students cheat during online exams.</li>
  <li> Survey we conducted via the Google form filled by various Institutes' students: more than 75% percent feel that online examinations is more of cheating and less of knowledge but if they won't cheat then others will score more.</li>
  <li> Survey conducted amongst the Thapar University Faculty conclusion: Need of better proctoring to be able to minimise the malicious practices and make the system more efficient via integration of hardware and software technologies.</li>
  <li> From the surveys, we got some solutions like double camera feed, wide angle camera, increasing field of view and advance AI. </li>
</ul>

## Tech used
<ul>
<li>Software: Pyhton, You Only Look Once (YOLO V4), Tensorflow, Google Colab, OPENCV, Rest.</li>
<li>Hardware: 3D Modelling via CREO, Stress Analysis on CREO, 3D Printing, Samsung Earphones wth mic, Lenovo Camera, Rest.</li>
</ul>

## Challenge
<ul>
<li>It can be difficult to design comfortable-fitting headphones. Product design engineers must be able to create products that are comfortable for a large number of people while keeping manufacturing costs low.</li>
