# YOLO_objDetection

YOLO or You Only Look Once, is a popular real-time object detection algorithm. 
It combines what was once a multi-step process, using a single neural network to perform both classification and prediction of bounding boxes for detected objects.

•	We have created Object Detection System for preventing Unfair Means of Cheating during Online Examination.
<br>
•	A camera is mounted on head which detects unacceptable objects during the exam.
