# Vision 360

## Why This Project?
<ul>
<li> During the COVID-19 Pandemic, examination process were forced to move in online form. </li>
<li> While online exams/proctoring had help in cost cutting and helped to reach applicants even in remote area, the one major issue regarding to this system is use of UNFAIR MEANS. </li>
<li> Main Goal: Develop a second feed camera system which could be combined with the already existing laptop webcam and minimize the blind spots which were vastly present with a single camera system.</li>
<li> Online exams which are less costly can thus be conducted in the future as well which can be proctored and indeed save the money given to the Proctors. </li>
<li> This has its application even in the call centers, all type of online examinations and wherever there is a need of proctoring.</li>
</ul>

## Overview
<ul>
  <li> Hardware: A band is created via 3D modelling. Special mount was created to place the camera for a better view. Band is made such that it completed the need of a microphone and a speaker which is a necessity of the online examinations. </li>
<li> This device smartly detects and prevents cheating by using AI combined with 360 degrees view to check if there are some objectionable means in the environment of the examine. </li>
</ul>

## Need Analysis
<ul>
  <li> 73% of students cheat during online exams.</li>
  <li> Survey we conducted via the Google form filled by various Institutes' students: 66% percent feel that online examinations is more of cheating and less of knowledge but if they won't cheat then others will score more.</li>
  <li> Survey conducted amongst the Thapar University Faculty conclusion: Need of better proctoring to be able to minimise the malicious practices and make the system more efficient via integration of hardware and software technologies.</li>
</ul>


YOLO or You Only Look Once, is a popular real-time object detection algorithm. 
It combines what was once a multi-step process, using a single neural network to perform both classification and prediction of bounding boxes for detected objects.
