## Need Analysis
<ul>
<li> During the COVID-19 Pandemic, examination process were forced to move in online form. </li>
<li> While online exams/proctoring had help in cost cutting and helped to reach applicants even in remote area, the one major issue regarding to this system is use of UNFAIR MEANS. </li>
<li> Main Goal: Develop a second feed camera system which could be combined with the already existing laptop webcam and minimize the blind spots which were vastly present with a single camera system.</li>
</ul>


YOLO or You Only Look Once, is a popular real-time object detection algorithm. 
It combines what was once a multi-step process, using a single neural network to perform both classification and prediction of bounding boxes for detected objects.

•	We have created Object Detection System for preventing Unfair Means of Cheating during Online Examination.
<br>
•	A camera is mounted on head which detects unacceptable objects during the exam.
